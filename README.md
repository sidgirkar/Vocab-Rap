# Vocab-Rap
An iOS app aiming to aid memorization of long lists of vocab terms by juxtaposing them 
with various instrumentals. Words are often best memorized when sung rather than repeatedly
stated, and through this app, ad-hoc "vocab raps" can be easily created and repeated. Through
this method, vocabulary can be learned in a more entertaining manner, and remembered for a 
longer period of time.
